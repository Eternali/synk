# synk
This is the in progress work of the synk project. Meant for real time collaborative coding.

It is completely a work in progress (read: a branch does not exist that is completely working).
But the goal is for this to become a sublime-text package that uses linting and diffing to enable multiple users to edit the
same file at the same time.
